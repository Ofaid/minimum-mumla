## Production admin portal status (2026-08-09)

- `web/` contains the Next.js admin portal and is deployed at `https://minimum.vra.or.th/` through
  Vercel's Next.js framework preset.
- Production persistence is Cloudflare KV over its REST API. The deployment requires the account,
  API-token and namespace environment variables plus 32-character-or-longer session and device-token
  hash secrets; no secret is stored in this repository.
- The first-run administrator handoff, pending-device queue, device CRUD, structured Schema-3 form,
  canonical per-model templates, automatic config-version advancement and one-time bearer-token
  rotation are implemented. Raw JSON is an Advanced fallback. Credential material is persisted as password/token
  hashes; device metadata/config remain persisted, and Android reads a device config through
  `Authorization: Bearer <device token>`.
- The **Channels & default** editor exposes `radio.defaultChannel` through a highlighted selector
  and per-channel **Set default** action while keeping Last Selected Channel as handset-owned state.
- Verification completed: the web test suite, TypeScript and the production Next.js build pass from
  `D:\mumla-dev\web`. Browser QA covered a two-server/two-channel save and version advance from v7
  to v8 plus a 390 px viewport without page-level horizontal overflow. The operator reported that
  production administrator setup and registration of the development T56/T99 records are complete.
